# RCFLIAP_Datasets
Following the approach of An et al. (2014), we randomly selected 35 nodes from a 49-node dataset. Specifically, we first assigned numbers from 0 to 48 for the 49 nodes and then generated random numbers within this range to select 15 facilities (renumbered 0-14). We subsequently selected 20 additional demand nodes from the remaining nodes(renumbered 0-19). Since this selection process was randomized, regional characteristics were not explicitly considered. 
To facilitate review, we have listed the relevant literature as follows:
